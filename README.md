Computer Science Classes
==========================

As a computer engineering/computer science student attending so much classes, 
and I want to see my code while its evolving. Also I used to wonder before i went to college how lessons are and
how things work?, what are the homeworks? Are they hard? If you are wondering like me maybe it would help to you.
