Tasks
    - Implement the get_hit_type function
        . It should probabilistically choose a hit type
        . Hit types are given as an enumeration
        . Probability of a NORMAL hit: 75%
        . Probability of a CRITICAL hit: 20%
        . Probability of a HEADSHOT: 5%
        . Return the hit type
        
    - In attack function
        . get a git type by calling the get_hit_type function
        . modify the damage according to the hit type
        . NORMAL hit does not change the damage
        . CRITICAl hit doubles the damage
        . HEADSHOT kills the enemy immediately
